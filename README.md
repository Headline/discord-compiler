# Discord Compiler Bot
A simple open-source Discord bot which can compile code, display the output of the compiler, and run the program. This bot is great for prototyping ideas, or testing concepts on-the-fly with very little effort. It supports almost every programing language on the market (c++, c, java, python, ruby, javascript, go, php, lua, & more!). 

**Adding this bot to your server is as simple as clicking [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=504095380166803466&scope=bot&permissions=388160).**
